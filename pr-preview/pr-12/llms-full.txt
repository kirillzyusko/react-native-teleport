# Installation

## Adding a library to the project[‚Äã](#adding-a-library-to-the-project "Direct link to Adding a library to the project")

Install the `react-native-teleport` package in your React Native project.

* YARN
* NPM
* EXPO

```
yarn add react-native-teleport
```

```
npm install react-native-teleport --save
```

```
npx expo install react-native-teleport
```

Only Expo Dev client compatible

This library has native code, so it **does not work** with *Expo Go* but it's fully compatible with [custom dev client](https://docs.expo.dev/development/getting-started/).

### Linking[‚Äã](#linking "Direct link to Linking")

This package supports [autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md).

Pods update

After adding the package don't forget to **re-install** `pods` and **re-assemble** `android` and `ios` applications, since this library contains native code.

If you still experience issues like **package doesn't seem to be linked** try performing a fresh build to clear any outdated cache.

## Adding provider[‚Äã](#adding-provider "Direct link to Adding provider")

In order to use it you'll need to wrap your app with `PortalProvider` component.

```
import { PortalProvider } from "react-native-teleport";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <PortalProvider>
      {/* your main application code goes here */}
    </PortalProvider>
  );
}
```

Congratulations! üéâ You've just finished installation process. Go to the [next section](/react-native-teleport/pr-preview/pr-12/docs/guides/portal.md) to get more insights of what you can do using this library. üòé

# Intro

## What is the portal?[‚Äã](#what-is-the-portal "Direct link to What is the portal?")

A **Portal** is a React concept that lets you render a component in a different place in the UI tree, while keeping it logically connected to its parent.

On the web, this is typically done with [`createPortal`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal).

Portals are commonly used for UI elements such as:

* Modals
* Tooltips
* Popovers
* Floating views

These are cases where the visual position of a component differs from its logical position in the React tree.

***

## Why another portal library for `react-native`?[‚Äã](#why-another-portal-library-for-react-native "Direct link to why-another-portal-library-for-react-native")

React Native does **not yet provide** a built-in `Portal` implementation ([issue #36273](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/36273)).<br /><!-- -->Existing community libraries, such as [@gorhom/portal](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-portal) or [react-gateway](https://github.com/cloudflare/react-gateway), solve this with **JavaScript-based portals**. They work well for many scenarios but come with important trade-offs:

‚ùå Components are **re-parented in JS**, not in the actual native view tree.<br /><!-- -->‚ùå This can break or block access to **React Context** values (theme, navigation, i18n, etc.).<br /><!-- -->‚ùå Rendering is still bound to the JS layer, which can limit **performance** and **platform-native behaviors**.

***

## Introducing `react-native-teleport`[‚Äã](#introducing-react-native-teleport "Direct link to introducing-react-native-teleport")

This library brings **true native portals** into React Native by teleportation views at the native layer (iOS/Android/web).

‚úÖ The component stays in the **original React tree**, preserving contexts and state.<br /><!-- -->‚úÖ The view is physically moved in the **native view hierarchy**, so layout, z-order, and performance behave like any other native view.<br /><!-- -->‚úÖ Works seamlessly across **iOS, Android, and Web**.

You can think of it as:

> **"Teleport your view in native space, without breaking React logic."**

## Why native portals matter[‚Äã](#why-native-portals-matter "Direct link to Why native portals matter")

In native development, portals are widely used to implement flexible UI patterns. Bringing them to React Native fills a long-standing gap:

* **Re-parenting without losing state** ‚Üí teleport a view while keeping its internal state intact.
* **Mirroring support** ‚Üí create a live copy of a view elsewhere in the tree (similar to a real-time snapshot).
* **Powerful composition** ‚Üí enable UI patterns that were previously difficult or impossible with JS-only portals.
