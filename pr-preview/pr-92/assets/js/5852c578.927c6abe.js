While they work, they have significant limitation: they **physically** render components in a **different part of React tree**, **breaking context** and bringing other related problems.\\n\\nThe `react-native-teleport` solves this problem by moving rendering of components in the native layer. This library provides a **declarative API**, doesn\'t rely on ***internal*** React implementation details, and **works identically** on **iOS, Android, and Web**.\\n\\n## Not only Portal\\n\\nAs you may noticed from the library title this library is **not only a portal solution**. It also provides a **re-parenting pattern** that allows you to **move existing components without unmounting or remounting** them.\\n\\nWith that technique you can build **advanced and seamless** transitions, implement **shared-element-style** transitions between screens, and more.\\n\\nFor example you can implement photos app transitions like this without flickering, white/black screens, jumps and other distracting things:\\n\\nimport Video from \\"@site/src/components/Video\\";\\n\\n<Video src=\\"/video/photos.mp4\\" width={35} />\\n<br />\\n\\nThe great thing is that view is **not re-created or destroyed** when it\'s moved between different parents. This mean you can use this lib for stateful components, like `Video`/`Lottie` etc. and you can easily replicate patterns that you\'ve seen in many well-known apps, for example you can re-build Instagram-like reels transition:\\n\\n<Video src=\\"/video/instagram.mov\\" width={35} />\\n<br />\\n\\n## Not only about transitions and rendering outside\\n\\nTraditionally, React has three operations in its reconciliation mechanism: **create**, **update**, and **destroy**. When you **move** a component from one parent to another in the React tree, it gets **destroyed** and **recreated**.\\n\\nBut effectively `react-native-teleport` **unlocks a new dimension** and introduces a fourth operation: **move**. This is a game-changer because it allows you to:\\n\\n### Pre-render Components Offscreen\\n\\nYou can render expensive components off-screen and move them into view only when needed. This is particularly useful for complex overlays, modals, or bottom sheets that require significant setup time.\\n\\n```tsx\\n// Pre-render the editor off-screen\\n<Portal hostName={used ? \'editor\' : undefined}>\\n  <ExpensiveRichTextEditor />\\n</Portal>\\n\\n// Later, when user triggers an action, simply move it into view\\n// No re-rendering, no state loss, just a native view reposition\\n```\\n\\n### Re-use Views Between Screens\\n\\nOne of the most powerful patterns enabled by the \\"**move**\\" operation is **view reuse across navigation transitions**. You can render the same component instance on multiple screens and seamlessly move it as users navigate.\\n\\nImagine you have the same component rendered twice on two different screens. If it\'s heavy for rendering a typical path is to dig into performance bottlenecks, fixing them etc. But with `react-native-teleport` you can **simply move** the component between screens \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\n### And more\\n\\nI\'m still exploring of what can be done with this library. Things that I discovered helped to build flicker free transitions while moving heavy views and helped to optimize performance from the angle that I never thought about (just re-using the view without re-creating it).\\n\\nBut I continue to explore what other patterns and use cases can be enabled with this library. I\'m also looking for feedback from the community and I\'m open to suggestions and ideas.\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nI have exciting plans for future releases:\\n\\n- \ud83e\ude9e Mirror support for advanced mirroring patterns\\n- \ud83d\ude80 Performance optimizations\\n- \ud83e\udd13 Additional platform support\\n- \ud83d\ude4c Community-driven features based on feedback\\n\\n## Thank You\\n\\nThis milestone wouldn\'t be possible without the incredible react-native community. Thank you to everyone who tested, provided feedback, reported issues, and contributed to making `react-native-teleport` better.\\n\\nIf you find this library useful, please consider:\\n\\n- \u2b50 Starring on [GitHub](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-teleport)\\n- \ud83d\udce2 Sharing with the community\\n- \ud83d\udc1b Reporting issues and providing feedback\\n- \ud83e\udd1d Contributing improvements"}]}}')}}]);
