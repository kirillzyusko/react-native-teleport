Hello!

You may be curious why another portal library for react-native is needed?

- component stays in react-tree
- package uses native primitives to teleport views (i. e. `createPortal` on web etc.)
- as a result we already can teleport views preserving internal component state
- in native development portals are also widespread concepts, but they even offer more advanced features such as "mirroring"
- the ultimate goal not only build primitives for teleportation views, but also provide a set of patterns and ready libs to build complex UIs (context menus, various shared transitions)

## Why native portals matter

In native development, portals are widely used to implement flexible UI patterns. Bringing them to React Native fills a long-standing gap:

- **Re-parenting without losing state** → teleport a view while keeping its internal state intact.
- **Mirroring support** → create a live copy of a view elsewhere in the tree (similar to a real-time snapshot).
- **Powerful composition** → enable UI patterns that were previously difficult or impossible with JS-only portals.
