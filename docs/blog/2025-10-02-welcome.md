Hello!

You may be curious why another portal library for react-native is needed?

- component stays in react-tree
- package uses native primitives to teleport views (i. e. `createPortal` on web etc.)
- as a result we already can teleport views preserving internal component state
- in native development portals are also widespread concepts, but they even offer more advanced features such as "mirroring"
- the ultimate goal not only build primitives for teleporting views, but also provide a set of patterns and ready libs to build complex UIs (context menus, various shared transitions)
