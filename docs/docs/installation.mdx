# Installation

## Adding a library to the project

:::warning New Architecture only
This library is compatible **only** with the **new (Fabric)** architecture.
:::

Install the `react-native-teleport` package in your React Native project.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN" default>

```shell
yarn add react-native-teleport
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```shell
npm install react-native-teleport --save
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="expo" label="EXPO">

```shell
npx expo install react-native-teleport
```

:::warning Only Expo Dev client compatible
This library has native code, so it **does not work** with _Expo Go_ but it's fully compatible with [custom dev client](https://docs.expo.dev/development/getting-started/).
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Linking

This package supports [autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md).

:::tip Pods update

After adding the package don't forget to **re-install** `pods` and **re-assemble** `android` and `ios` applications, since this library contains native code.

If you still experience issues like **package doesn't seem to be linked** try performing a fresh build to clear any outdated cache.
:::

## Adding provider

In order to use it you'll need to wrap your app with `PortalProvider` component.

```tsx
import { PortalProvider } from "react-native-teleport";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <PortalProvider>
      {/* your main application code goes here */}
    </PortalProvider>
  );
}
```

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You've just finished installation process. Go to the [next section](./guides/portal.md) to get more insights of what you can do using this library. ðŸ˜Ž
