# Intro

## What is the portal?

A **Portal** lets you render a component somewhere else in the UI tree, while keeping it logically inside its parent.  
Typical use cases include **modals**, **tooltips**, **popovers**, and other overlays where the visual position differs from the React tree position.

On the web this is done with [`createPortal`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal), but React Native has no built-in solution ([issue #36273](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/36273)).

## Existing solutions (and their limits)

Community libraries like [@gorhom/portal](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-portal) or [react-gateway](https://github.com/cloudflare/react-gateway) emulate portals in **JavaScript**. They work, but:

❌ Components are **re-parented in JS**, not in the actual native view tree.  
❌ This can break or block access to **React Context** values (theme, navigation, i18n, etc.).  
❌ Rendering is still bound to the JS layer, which can limit **performance** and **platform-native behaviors**.

## Introducing `react-native-teleport`

This library brings **true native portals** to React Native:

✅ The component stays in the **original React tree** → contexts & state are preserved.  
✅ The view is physically moved in the **native view hierarchy** → correct layout, z-order & performance.  
✅ Works across **iOS, Android, and Web**.  
✅ Supports not only portals but also **re-parenting (teleport)**: move an existing view without unmounting it.

You can think of it as:

> **"Teleport your view in native space, without breaking React logic."**
