### Installation

```

### Usage

First of all, you need to add `PortalProvider` to your root component - this is usually `App.tsx`:

```tsx
import {PortalProvider} from "react-native-teleport";

export const App = () => (
  <PortalProvider>
    {/* your app goes here */}
  </PortalProvider>
);
```

Then wrap the content that you want to teleport with `Portal`:

```tsx
import {Portal} from "react-native-teleport";

export const App = () => (
  <Portal name="root">
    <View style={{backgroundColor: "red"}}>
      <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
    </View>
  </Portal>
);
```
